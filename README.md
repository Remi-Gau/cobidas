# eCOBIDAS

**A checklist for methods and results reporting for neuroimaging studies**

You can try this app [HERE](https://ohbm.github.io/cobidas/#/).

This checklist is still work in progress. The current prototype has been built using the 88 metadata items list used by the [Neurovault website](https://neurovault.org/) when uploading your neuroimaging results.

We are currently working to create a more complete checklist as described in the COBIDAS reports for MRI, fMRI, EEG and MEG (see [below](#Background) for more information).

## How to use it

You can navigate each section on the left and then answer the questions corresponding to your fMRI analysis. This is meant to make sure that you have not forgotten any of the essential information in the methods and results parts of your article.

At the end, you can click on `Export` (bottom left) to get a machine readable json file that recaps your method/results section: our next step is to use this to automate the part of the methods writing.

## Why this project?

Poor methods and results description hinders the reproducibility and the replicability of research. It also makes it hard to compare new and old results and generally increases inefficiency in the research process. This project is built on the hope that improving methods and results reporting could improve our research.

## Background

This checklist is a project to make a user friendly checklist out the best practices [report](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/054262v2) of the Committee on Best Practices in Data Analysis and Sharing ([COBIDAS](https://www.humanbrainmapping.org/i4a/pages/index.cfm?pageid=3728)) of the Organization for human brain mapping.

Currently the sections and items in the checklist correspond to the list of metadata used by [neurovault website](https://neurovault.org/) when uploading your neuroimaging results.

This is very much of a work in progress but the next step is to expand the list to cover all the items of the COBIDAS report for fMRI as well as for the recent [extension to EEG and MEG](https://osf.io/a8dhx/).

From more frequent updates and behind the scenes, come and join us on the `cobidas_checklist` channel on the brainhack mattermost. <a href="https://mattermost.brainhack.org/brainhack/channels/cobidas_checklist"><img src="http://www.mattermost.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/logoHorizontal.png" width=100px /> Join our channel </a>

There is also an [OSF project](https://osf.io/anvqy/) to centralize all the information and repos.

We have a [list](https://github.com/Remi-Gau/COBIDAS_chckls/blob/master/goals.md) of short, middle, long term goals: if you are interested by any of those get in touch. Many of them do not necessarily require super-advanced technical skills (except maybe a certain love for working with spreadsheet and wanting them to be super organized) :wink:.
