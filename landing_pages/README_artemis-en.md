## How to use it

You can navigate each section on the left and then answer the questions
corresponding to your study. This is meant to make sure that you have not
forgotten any of the essential information during data collection or later in
the methods and results parts of your article.

At the end, you can click on `Export` (bottom left) to get a zip file containing
a set of machine readable files that summarize the information about your
acquisition protocol.
