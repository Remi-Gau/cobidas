<h1>COBIDAS Information Collection Protocol</h1>
<p>The aim of this protocol is to help users collect information related to the
different components of the COBIDAS protocol.</p>

<p>This checklist is still work in progress. The current prototype has been built using the 88 metadata items list used by the <a href="https://neurovault.org/">Neurovault website</a> when uploading your neuroimaging results.</p>

<p>We are currently working to create a more complete checklist as described in the OHBM COBIDAS reports for MRI, fMRI, EEG, MEG and PET.</p>

<h2>How to use it</h2>

<p>You can navigate each section on the left and then answer the questions corresponding to your fMRI analysis. This is meant to make sure that you have not forgotten any of the essential information in the methods and results parts of your article.</p>

<p>At the end, you can click on <b>Export</b> (bottom left) to get a zip file containing machine readable json files that captures information about your method/results section: our next step is to use this to automate the part of the methods writing and to submit the information alongside data submission to Neurovault and other data archives.</p>

<h2>Have any questions? Something is missing? Let us know.</h2>

<ul>
<li> drop us an email on our <a href="https://groups.google.com/d/forum/cobidas-checklist">google group</a>.</li>
<li> open an issue this <a href="https://github.com/Remi-Gau/COBIDAS_chckls">github repository</a>.</li>
<li> leave a message on the <b>cobidas_checklist</b> channel on the brainhack <a href="https://mattermost.brainhack.org/brainhack/channels/cobidas_checklist"><img src="mattermost.png" width=100px /> channel.</a></li>
</ul>

<h2>Why this project?</h2>

<p>Poor methods and results description hinders the reproducibility and the replicability of research. It also makes it hard to compare new and old results and generally increases inefficiency in the research process. This project is built on the hope that improving methods and results reporting could improve our research.</p>

<h2>Background</h2>

<p>This checklist is a project to make a user friendly checklist out the best practices <a href="https://www.humanbrainmapping.org/COBIDASreport">report</a> of the Committee on Best Practices in Data Analysis and Sharing (<a href="https://www.humanbrainmapping.org/cobidas/">COBIDAS</a>) of the <a href="https://www.humanbrainmapping.org">Organization for Human Brain Mapping</a>.</p>

Currently the sections and items in the checklist correspond to the list of metadata used by <a href="https://neurovault.org/">neurovault website</a> when uploading your neuroimaging results.</p>

<p>This is very much of a work in progress but the next step is to expand the list to cover all the items of the COBIDAS report for fMRI as well as for the recent <a href="https://osf.io/a8dhx/">extension to EEG and MEG</a>.</p>

<h2>Want to help?</h2>

<p>We are currently working on trying to expand the number of items used in the checklist. All of this work is done in google spreadsheets.</p>

<ul>
<li> the MRI spreadsheet is accessible <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dCXP0MTK3DjY09ZFd7FXgv0Ngx16_YJwVBiXOeQbTho/edit?usp=sharing">here</a></li>
<li> the M/EEG spreadsheet is accessible <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OhkmbtgIWdFxSVjpu6A8PWoAuqev0jY-98GFQlwBCy0/edit?usp=sharing">here</a></li>
<li> the PET spreadsheet is accessible <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HS-1KOP8nE7C3MHiyRmQ6hd823cBZnCRVq0UryXvDc8/edit?usp=sharing">here</a></li>
<li> for more information on the content and organization of these spreadsheets, see the dedicated <a href="https://github.com/Remi-Gau/COBIDAS_chckls/blob/master/spreadsheet_content.md">document</a></li>

There is also an [OSF project](https://osf.io/anvqy/) to centralize all the information and repos.</p>

<p>We have a <a href="https://github.com/Remi-Gau/COBIDAS_chckls/blob/master/goals.md">list</a> of short, middle, long term goals: if you are interested by any of those get in touch. Many of them do not necessarily require super-advanced technical skills (except maybe a certain love for working with spreadsheet and wanting them to be super organized).</p>
